                    Rent my caravan has been the UK's No.1 caravan renting site for 15 years,
                    thanks to our family values that we have been incorporating throughout 
                    our business. It started in 2005 when Eddie Bican, the founder of RentMyCaravan,
                    was trying to find a way to keep his prized caravan instead of selling it.
